# Notes:
# - This environment file installs core binary packages with conda (via conda-forge)
#   and delegates the rest of the Python-only packages to pip using the pinned
#   `requirements-pinned.txt` file. That keeps conda in control of compiled
#   libraries while still reproducing the exact Python package set used during
#   validation.
# - For GPU users who need a CUDA-enabled PyTorch build, prefer installing
#   PyTorch via the official instructions at https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally
#   rather than relying on the pip wheel in the pinned requirements. Example
#   (uncomment and adapt for your hardware):
#
#   dependencies:
#     - pytorch=2.8.0
#     - cudatoolkit=12.8
#
#   or use the `pytorch` channel and the specific cuda build recommended by PyTorch.
