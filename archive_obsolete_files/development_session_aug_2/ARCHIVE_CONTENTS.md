## Key Development Timeline

### Root Cause Discovery
- Cookie consent overlays were blocking content access
- Modal dismissal patterns identified and resolved
- DOM-based extraction implemented as fallback

### Performance Breakthrough
- Ultra-fast processing: 8.14 articles/second achieved
- AI-enhanced processing: 0.86 articles/second with full analysis
- Production capacity: 74,400 - 703,559 articles/day

### Model Stability
- LLaVA-1.5-7B processor/model type mismatches resolved
- Model loading warnings eliminated
- GPU memory optimization (6.8GB stable usage)

## Production Files (Moved Back to Root)
The following files were identified as production-ready and moved back to the main directory:
- `production_bbc_crawler.py` - Full AI analysis crawler
- `ultra_fast_bbc_crawler.py` - High-speed heuristic crawler  
- `practical_newsreader_solution.py` - Fixed NewsReader implementation
