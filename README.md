## Architecture

The system is built on a microservices architecture where each service is an independent AI agent. These agents communicate via a central **MCP (Model Context Protocol) Message Bus**. This allows for a flexible, scalable, and dynamic system where agents can delegate tasks and collaborate to achieve complex goals.

**V4 RTX Architecture**: JustNews V4 introduces GPU-accelerated news analysis with current V3.5 implementation patterns achieving V4 performance targets. Full RTX AI Toolkit integration (TensorRT-LLM, AIM SDK, AI Workbench) planned for Phase 2 migration while maintaining current performance levels.

   - **Ubuntu Native**: 8-12 articles/sec expected (40-110% improvement)

### Database Setup & Migrations


Database migrations are located in `agents/memory/db_migrations/`. To apply them manually (from the project root):

```bash
docker-compose exec db psql -U user -d justnews -f /app/db_migrations/001_create_articles_table.sql
docker-compose exec db psql -U user -d justnews -f /app/db_migrations/002_create_training_examples_table.sql
docker-compose exec db psql -U user -d justnews -f /app/db_migrations/003_create_article_vectors_table.sql
```


### ML, Feedback Loops & Continual Learning

All major agents implement machine learning-based feedback loops for continual improvement:

- **Synthesizer**: Uses sentence-transformers for clustering (KMeans, BERTopic, HDBSCAN), LLM for neutralization/aggregation, and logs feedback from Critic/Chief Editor for continual learning. Clustering method is set via `SYNTHESIZER_CLUSTER_METHOD`.
- **Critic**: Uses LLM for critique, logs all feedback and editorial outcomes for retraining and adaptation. Optional fact-checking pipeline can be enabled with `CRITIC_USE_FACTCHECK=1`.
- **Memory**: Provides semantic retrieval with embeddings and vector search, logs all retrievals and downstream outcomes for future learning-to-rank and model improvement. Tool interfaces are mirrored in `tools.py` for clarity and local testing.

**Feedback Logging:**
- All agents log feedback to agent-specific files (e.g., `./feedback_synthesizer.log`) and/or the database.
- Feedback includes tool usage, outcomes, errors, and user/editorial input.
- Standardized logging format: UTC timestamp, event, details (as JSON/dict).

**Retraining & Continual Learning:**
- Feedback logs are used for both online and scheduled retraining.
- Retraining procedures are documented in each agent's code and can be automated via scripts or CI/CD.
- See `action_plan.md` and agent `tools.py` for retraining hooks and feedback usage.

### API Endpoints

Each agent exposes its tools as HTTP endpoints (see `main.py` in each agent folder). The MCP bus provides `/register`, `/call`, and `/agents` endpoints for agent discovery and tool invocation.

### Docker GPU Troubleshooting

**GPU Access Issues:**
- Ensure NVIDIA Container Toolkit is installed and configured
- Verify Docker can access GPU: `docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.8-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi`
- Check GPU resources in Docker Desktop settings (increase memory limits)

**Model Loading Issues:**
- Verify model files exist: `ls -la ~/mistral_models/7B-Instruct-v0.3/`
- Check volume mounting in docker-compose logs
- For Windows, copy `docker-compose.override.example.yml` to `docker-compose.override.yml` and adjust paths

**Memory Issues:**
- Analyst agent requires ~14.5GB VRAM for optimal performance
- If OOM errors occur, check available GPU memory: `nvidia-smi`
- Consider reducing batch size or using CPU fallback by removing GPU config

### Dual Functionality: Standalone Execution & MCP Bus Integration

Each agent can be started independently while maintaining the ability to communicate with other agents via the MCP Bus. Follow the instructions below for standalone execution and MCP Bus integration:

#### Standalone Execution
Each agent can operate independently without relying on other agents or services. See the "Standalone Execution" section above for detailed instructions.

#### MCP Bus Integration
When the MCP Bus is available, agents will automatically register their tools and use the bus for inter-agent communication. This allows for dynamic collaboration between agents.

**Key Features:**
- Agents register their tools with the MCP Bus upon startup.
- If the MCP Bus is unavailable, agents will continue to operate independently.
- Error handling ensures smooth operation in standalone mode.

**Starting the MCP Bus:**
1. Navigate to the `mcp_bus` directory.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Start the MCP Bus:
    ```bash
    uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
    ```

**Agent Registration:**
Agents will automatically attempt to register their tools with the MCP Bus at `http://localhost:8000`. Ensure the MCP Bus is running before starting agents for full functionality.
