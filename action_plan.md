  - Log fact-check outcomes and user/editor feedback for retraining.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for claim validation and verification.

---

## 4. Analyst Agent
- **Replace rule-based logic with ML/LLM:**
  - Use LLM or ML models for `score_bias`, `score_sentiment`, and `identify_entities`.
  - Integrate with NER and sentiment analysis libraries (spaCy, transformers, etc.).
- **Add feedback logging:**
  - Log analysis results and feedback for model improvement.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for bias, sentiment, and entity recognition.

---

## 5. Synthesizer Agent
- **Enhance clustering and aggregation:**
  - Add error handling and validation for clustering and LLM calls.
  - Support additional clustering algorithms (BERTopic, HDBSCAN).
- **Ensure feedback loop is used in retraining:**
  - Automate periodic retraining using logged feedback.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for clustering, neutralization, and aggregation.

---

## 6. Critic Agent

  - Add error handling for LLM pipeline.
  - Integrate optional fact-checking pipeline for cross-referencing.
- **Ensure feedback loop is used in retraining:**
  - Automate periodic retraining using logged feedback.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for critique synthesis and neutrality.

---

## 7. Memory Agent
- **Clarify tool interface:**
  - Move or mirror key tool interfaces from `main.py` to `tools.py` for clarity and maintainability.
- **Enhance error handling:**
  - Add robust error handling for DB and embedding/model calls.
- **Ensure feedback loop is used for learning-to-rank:**
  - Use logged retrievals and outcomes to improve ranking models.
- **Testing:**
  - Add tests for semantic retrieval, vector search, and feedback logging.

---

## 8. General/All Agents
- **Documentation:**
  - Update docstrings and README sections for all new/changed logic.
- **Feedback Loop:**
  - Standardize feedback logging format and location across agents.
  - Document retraining and continual learning procedures.
- **CI/CD:**
  - Add/expand tests to cover new ML/LLM logic and feedback mechanisms.

---

## 9. Timeline & Milestones
1. **Week 1:** Replace stubs/rule-based logic in Scout, Fact-Checker, Analyst. Add feedback logging to all agents.
2. **Week 2:** Implement real MCP bus integration for Chief Editor. Enhance orchestration and error handling.
3. **Week 3:** Expand clustering/aggregation in Synthesizer. Add fact-checking pipeline to Critic. Move tool interfaces in Memory.
