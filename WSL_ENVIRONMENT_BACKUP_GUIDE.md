# WSL Environment Recreation Guide
# JustNews V4 Development Environment Restoration

## üéØ Summary: WSL Environment is Fully Recreatable

**Good News**: The entire WSL Ubuntu environment can be recreated from the git repository content. No critical code or configuration lives only in WSL.

## üìã What's in WSL vs Git

### ‚úÖ Safely in Git (All Critical Content)
- **All Python scripts**: `test_tensorrt_llm.py`, `test_rapids_hardware.py`, etc.
- **Installation scripts**: `setup_tensorrt_llm.sh` with complete TensorRT-LLM setup
- **Documentation**: Complete technical documentation and validation procedures
- **JustNews V4 code**: All agent implementations and configuration files
- **Environment specifications**: Requirements files and Docker configurations

### üîÑ WSL Contains Only Recreatable Content
- **RAPIDS Environment**: Standard installation (`mamba create...`)
- **TensorRT-LLM**: Installable via our `setup_tensorrt_llm.sh` script
- **RTX AI Toolkit**: Public GitHub repository (can be re-cloned)
- **System packages**: Standard Ubuntu/NVIDIA packages via SDK Manager
- **Utility scripts**: Small helper scripts (now backed up in `wsl_scripts/`)

## üöÄ Complete Environment Recreation Process

### Step 1: NVIDIA SDK Manager Installation
```bash
# This recreates the entire NVIDIA-SDKM-Ubuntu-24.04 environment
# Including CUDA 12.9, cuDNN, TensorRT, and all NVIDIA libraries
```

### Step 2: RAPIDS Installation
```bash
# Recreate the RAPIDS environment exactly
mamba create -n rapids25.06_python3.12 -c rapidsai -c conda-forge -c nvidia \
    rapids=25.6.0 python=3.12 cuda-version=12.9
source activate rapids25.06_python3.12
```

### Step 3: TensorRT-LLM Installation
```bash
# Our script handles the complete TensorRT-LLM setup
git clone <this-repo>
./setup_tensorrt_llm.sh
# This installs TensorRT-LLM, configures MPI, and validates the installation
```

### Step 4: RTX AI Toolkit
```bash
# Re-clone the public repository
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/RTX-AI-Toolkit
# All deployment guides and examples are included
```

### Step 5: Validation
```bash
# Run our comprehensive test suite
python test_tensorrt_llm.py        # 6/6 tests should pass
python test_rapids_hardware.py     # Hardware validation
python test_tensorrt_performance.py # GPU performance verification
```

## üíæ What We Backed Up vs What We Don't Need To

### ‚úÖ Backed Up in Git
- **Complete installation procedures** (can recreate environment 100%)
- **All custom code and scripts** (nothing lives only in WSL)
- **Documentation and validation** (comprehensive recreation guides)
- **Environment specifications** (exact versions and dependencies)

### ‚ùå Don't Need to Back Up
- **Python virtual environments** (recreatable from requirements)
- **Downloaded models** (can be re-downloaded)
- **Compiled libraries** (reinstalled by package managers)
- **System packages** (part of standard installations)

## üéØ Disaster Recovery Capability

### Scenario: Complete WSL Loss
**Recovery Time**: 2-3 hours (mostly installation waiting time)
**Data Loss**: Zero (all critical content in git)
**Process**: 
1. Reinstall NVIDIA SDK Manager
2. Run our installation scripts
3. Validate with our test suite
4. Resume development

### Scenario: Corruption or Issues
**Recovery Time**: 30 minutes
**Process**:
1. Backup any work-in-progress
2. Delete and recreate WSL environment
3. Run recreation scripts
4. Restore work-in-progress

## üéâ Conclusion

**The WSL environment is completely expendable and recreatable.**

- ‚úÖ All critical code, documentation, and procedures are safely in git
- ‚úÖ The entire environment can be recreated from scratch in 2-3 hours
- ‚úÖ No data loss risk - everything important is version controlled
- ‚úÖ Installation scripts ensure consistent recreation every time

**Recommendation**: No additional backup needed. The git repository contains everything required to recreate the exact same environment on any RTX 3090 system.
