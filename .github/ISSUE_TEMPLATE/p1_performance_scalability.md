## Summary

Performance and scalability improvements across GPU execution, TensorRT governance,
throughput pipeline, caching/deduplication, and vector search. Derived from
System_Assessment_2025-08-09.

## Tasks

- [ ] GPU utilities
  - [ ] Implement shared `gpu_utils` with `safe_gpu_operation`, memory logging
        (allocated vs reserved), mixed precision controls, and leak delta checks
  - [ ] Add CUDA stream management helpers and standardized cleanup
  - [ ] Log per-operation GPU memory and duration via structured logs

- [ ] TensorRT governance
  - [ ] Engine cache + versioning strategy with metadata (dynamic shapes, max
        workspace)
  - [ ] INT8 calibration artifacts and reproducible scripts (where applicable)
  - [ ] Validation harness with performance regression tests per model/version
  - [ ] Gate CI on performance thresholds (throughput and p95 latency)

- [ ] Throughput & pipeline
  - [ ] Async I/O for network and disk-bound ops
  - [ ] Pipelined H2D/D2H transfers with CUDA streams
  - [ ] Batch coalescing: default 16–32, peak 100; auto-batch by GPU occupancy
  - [ ] Concurrency controls and queue depth-based backpressure

- [ ] Caching & deduplication
  - [ ] Article fingerprinting (URL + content hash)
  - [ ] Result cache with TTL and invalidation rules
  - [ ] Deduplicate at MCP entry to prevent duplicate downstream work

- [ ] Vector store optimization
  - [ ] Confirm pgvector/FAISS configuration; enable appropriate indexes
  - [ ] Connection pooling + prepared statements
  - [ ] Partitioning/retention policies for embeddings and raw content

- [ ] Autoscaling & policies
  - [ ] Define scaling based on queue depth and GPU utilization
  - [ ] Emit backpressure signals when targets exceeded

- [ ] Benchmarks & SLOs
  - [ ] Define SLOs for throughput and latency per agent
  - [ ] Add benchmark suite; publish p50/p95/p99 and throughput to Grafana

- [ ] Training & Model Operations (P1 cross-cutting)
  - [ ] Model registry with versioned configs and rollout metadata
  - [ ] Canary rollouts + automated rollback on degradation
  - [ ] Input/label drift detection and alerting
  - [ ] Golden evals integrated into CI for key tasks

- [ ] Security & resource limits (P1 related)
  - [ ] Rate limiting on public endpoints; inter-agent limits as needed
  - [ ] docker-compose resource requests/limits for CPU and memory
  - [ ] Ensure CPU fallback paths are controllable via config

## Acceptance Criteria

- Pipeline achieves targeted throughput and p95 latency improvements; no new
  regressions vs baseline; CI gates enforce thresholds
- GPU memory leak delta is ~0 over extended runs; mixed precision usage is
  documented and safe for selected models
- Cache hit rate >= agreed target; duplicate processing reduced materially
- Vector query p95 below target; stable under expected concurrency
- Autoscaling triggers operate as designed; backpressure prevents overload
- Benchmarks/SLOs visible in Grafana; changes recorded in CHANGELOG
