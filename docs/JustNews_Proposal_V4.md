The Reasoning Agent is a dedicated neuro-symbolic component for fact validation, contradiction detection, and explainability. It leverages the Nucleoid framework to:
- Ingest facts and rules from other agents
- Perform symbolic logic queries and contradiction checks
- Provide explainable outputs for editorial and fact-checking workflows
- Integrate with the MCP bus for seamless orchestration

### Use Cases
- **Fact Validation**: Logical validation of claims extracted by Scout, Analyst, or Fact Checker
- **Contradiction Detection**: Identifies logical inconsistencies within or across articles
- **Explainability**: Supplies human-readable logic chains for editorial review
- **Editorial Support**: Assists Chief Editor and Critic with logic-based recommendations

### Technical Details
- **API Endpoints**: `/add_fact`, `/add_facts`, `/add_rule`, `/query`, `/evaluate`, `/health`
- **MCP Bus Integration**: Registers tools and responds to `/call` requests
- **Port**: 8008 (default)
- **Resource Usage**: <1GB RAM, CPU only

### Example Workflow
1. Scout or Analyst extracts a claim
2. Fact Checker verifies with neural models
3. Reasoning Agent ingests as fact, applies rules
4. Contradictions flagged and reported to editorial agents
5. Editorial workflow uses Reasoning Agent's explanations for transparency
