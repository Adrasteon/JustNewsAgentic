"""Common graceful shutdown helper for JustNews agents.

Provides a small utility to register a `/shutdown` endpoint on a FastAPI app
that triggers a clean process shutdown (SIGINT) after responding. The handler
optionally requires a token provided via environment variable `SHUTDOWN_TOKEN`
for safety in shared networks.

Usage:
    from agents.common.shutdown import register_shutdown_endpoint
    register_shutdown_endpoint(app)

The endpoint is POST /shutdown and returns 202 immediately.
