## 🏗️ Current System Architecture Issues

### Major Problems:
1. **Functional Redundancy**: Multiple agents doing identical tasks
2. **Quality Inconsistency**: Scout V2 production-ready, others basic
3. **Resource Inefficiency**: GPU underutilization across agents
4. **Maintenance Complexity**: Multiple implementations to maintain
5. **Result Conflicts**: Different agents producing conflicting analyses

### Technical Debt:
- **DialoGPT-medium overuse**: 5 agents using basic conversational model
- **Limited GPU integration**: Only 2 of 10 agents use GPU effectively
- **Inconsistent error handling**: No standard patterns across agents
- **Mixed model strategies**: No coherent approach to AI model selection
