## 🔍 Detailed Overlap Analysis

### 1. Sentiment Analysis Overlaps ❌

**Scout V2 Implementation** (Production Standard):
```python
# Specialized RoBERTa model
model: "cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"
- Multi-class: Positive, Negative, Neutral
- Intensity levels: Weak, Mild, Moderate, Strong
- GPU acceleration with zero warnings
- Robust error handling with heuristic fallback
```

**Analyst Implementation** (Redundant):
```python
# Basic Mistral-7B prompts
def score_sentiment(text): 
    # Uses general LLM with prompt engineering
    # Less specialized, lower accuracy
    # Native TensorRT acceleration (good)
```

**Critic Implementation** (Partial Overlap):
```python
# Emotional language detection
emotional_words = ['outrageous', 'shocking', 'devastating', ...]
# Basic keyword-based approach
```

**Recommendation**: 
- Remove sentiment analysis from Analyst and Critic
- Centralize all sentiment analysis in Scout V2
- Analyst focuses on entity extraction and numerical analysis
- Critic focuses on logical consistency and fact verification

### 2. Bias Detection Overlaps ❌

**Scout V2 Implementation** (Production Standard):
```python
# Specialized bias detection model
model: "martin-ha/toxic-comment-model"
- Multi-level bias assessment: Minimal, Low, Medium, High
- Toxicity detection capabilities
- Context-aware analysis
- Bias penalty system in scoring
```

**Analyst Implementation** (Redundant):
```python
def score_bias(text):
    # Basic Mistral-7B bias detection via prompts
    # General approach, less specialized
```

**Critic Implementation** (Partial Overlap):
```python
def _detect_bias_indicators(content):
    # Keyword-based bias indicators
    # Political loaded terms detection
    # Absolute statements detection
```

**Recommendation**:
- Remove bias detection from Analyst and Critic  
- Centralize all bias analysis in Scout V2
- Critic focuses on logical fallacies and argument structure
- Analyst focuses on quantitative metrics and trends

### 3. Content Quality Assessment Overlaps ⚠️

**Scout V2 Implementation** (Comprehensive):
- News classification (35% weight)
- Quality assessment (25% weight) 
- Integrated scoring system
- Multi-modal analysis capability

**Other Agents** (Limited):
- Basic content evaluation through respective models
- No standardized quality metrics
- Inconsistent scoring approaches

## 🏗️ Current vs Target Architecture

### Current Architecture Issues:

1. **Functional Redundancy**: Multiple agents doing sentiment/bias analysis
2. **Inconsistent Quality**: Scout V2 production-ready, others limited
3. **GPU Utilization**: Only Scout and Analyst use GPU effectively
4. **Model Diversity**: Mix of DialoGPT, Mistral, specialized models
5. **Error Handling**: Inconsistent approaches across agents
