## Performance Metrics

### Production-Validated Performance

| Metric | Value | Details |
|--------|--------|---------|
| **Training Rate** | 48 examples/minute | Real-time processing from news data |
| **Model Updates** | 82.3 updates/hour | Across all agents |
| **Data Generation** | 2,880 examples/hour | From 28,800 articles/hour BBC crawler |
| **Update Frequency** | ~35 minutes/agent | Based on threshold completion |
| **Quality Rate** | ~10% | Articles generating meaningful training data |

### Agent-Specific Thresholds

| Agent | Update Threshold | Training Focus |
|-------|------------------|----------------|
| **Scout V2** | 40 examples | News classification, quality assessment, sentiment analysis, bias detection |
| **Fact Checker V2** | 30 examples | Fact verification, credibility assessment, contradiction detection |
| **Analyst** | 35 examples | Entity extraction, topic classification |
| **Critic** | 25 examples | Content evaluation, logical assessment |

## Training Features

### Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC)

**Purpose**: Prevents catastrophic forgetting while enabling new learning
**Implementation**: Fisher Information Matrix calculation for important parameter identification
**Benefits**: Maintains performance on existing knowledge while incorporating new patterns

**Code Example**:
```python
# EWC loss calculation
ewc_loss = 0
for name, param in model.named_parameters():
    if name in fisher_dict:
        ewc_loss += (fisher_dict[name] * (param - optimal_params[name]) ** 2).sum()
```

### Active Learning

**Purpose**: Intelligent training example selection based on uncertainty and importance
**Metrics**: 
- Uncertainty Score: 0.0-1.0 (model confidence inversion)
- Importance Score: 0.0-1.0 (editorial significance, source credibility)
- Combined Score: Weighted combination for selection priority

**Selection Algorithm**:
```python
uncertainty_score = 1.0 - max(prediction_confidence_scores)
importance_score = calculate_importance(content, source, user_priority)
combined_score = (uncertainty_score * 0.6) + (importance_score * 0.4)
```

### Priority System

**Priority Levels**:
- **Priority 1**: Medium priority (standard processing queue)
- **Priority 2**: High priority (accelerated processing)  
- **Priority 3**: Critical priority (immediate processing, bypasses threshold)

**Immediate Updates**: Priority 3 corrections trigger instant model updates regardless of buffer status

### Rollback Protection

**Threshold**: 5% accuracy drop from baseline performance
**Monitoring**: Continuous performance tracking with moving average calculation
**Action**: Automatic model restoration to previous checkpoint if degradation detected
**Recovery**: Graceful fallback with user notification and manual override capability

## Agent Integration

### Scout V2 Training Integration

**Models Supported**:
1. **News Classification**: BERT-based binary news vs non-news detection
2. **Quality Assessment**: BERT-based content quality evaluation (low/medium/high)
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: RoBERTa-based sentiment classification with intensity
4. **Bias Detection**: Specialized toxicity model for bias and inflammatory content
5. **Visual Analysis**: LLaVA multimodal model (training infrastructure ready)

**Integration Points**:
```python
# Scout V2 training example submission
from training_system import add_training_feedback

add_training_feedback(
    agent_name="scout",
    task_type="news_classification", 
    input_text=article_content,
    prediction="news",
    confidence=0.85,
    actual_result="news",  # Ground truth
    uncertainty=0.15,
    importance=0.8
)
```

### Fact Checker V2 Training Integration

**Models Supported**:
1. **Fact Verification**: DistilBERT-based factual vs questionable classification
2. **Credibility Assessment**: RoBERTa-based source reliability scoring
3. **Contradiction Detection**: BERT-large logical consistency checking
4. **Evidence Retrieval**: SentenceTransformers semantic search optimization
5. **Claim Extraction**: spaCy NER verifiable claims identification

**Correction Handling**:
```python
# Fact Checker correction submission  
from agents.fact_checker.tools import correct_fact_verification

correct_fact_verification(
    claim="The Earth is flat",
    context="Scientific consensus disagrees", 
    incorrect_classification="factual",
    correct_classification="questionable",
    priority=3  # Critical priority for immediate update
)
```

## GPU Safety & Reliability

### Professional CUDA Management

**GPU Model Manager Features**:
- **Model Registration**: Automatic tracking of all GPU models and pipelines
- **Context Managers**: Safe GPU operations with guaranteed cleanup
- **Signal Handlers**: Graceful shutdown handling for SIGINT/SIGTERM signals
- **Memory Management**: Systematic CUDA cache clearing and synchronization

**Usage Example**:
```python
from training_system.utils.gpu_cleanup import GPUModelManager

# Context manager for safe GPU operations
with GPUModelManager() as gpu_manager:
    model = load_gpu_model()  
    gpu_manager.register_model("my_model", model)
    # Automatic cleanup on context exit
```

### Core Dump Resolution

**Problem**: PyTorch GPU cleanup during Python shutdown causing segmentation faults
**Solution**: Professional CUDA context management with proper cleanup order
**Result**: Zero core dumps achieved with completely clean shutdown process

**Key Fixes**:
1. **Variable Name Conflict**: Fixed pipeline variable shadowing in Scout V2 engine
2. **Import Error**: Added missing `get_scout_engine` function for training system access
3. **Model Registration**: Proper GPU model tracking with cleanup registration
4. **Memory Cleanup**: Systematic tensor cleanup and garbage collection
